STAC API Python Client
======================

The STAC API Python Client (``pystac_api``) is a Python package for working with APIs that conform to the
`STAC API spec <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec>`__ and related specifications.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: console

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/duckontheweb/pystac-api.git#egg=pystac_api

``pystac_api`` requires `Python >=3.6 <https://www.python.org/>`__.

This will also install the following Python packages as dependencies:

* :doc:`PySTAC <pystac:index>`: For working with STAC objects in Python
* :doc:`requests <requests:index>`: For making HTTP requests

Acknowledgements
----------------

This package builds upon the great work of the PySTAC library for working with STAC objects in Python. It also uses
concepts from the `sat-search <https://github.com/sat-utils/sat-search>`__ library for working with STAC API - Item
Search endpoints.

Supported Specifications
------------------------

This library is intended to work with services that implement 1 or more of the following specifications:

* `STAC API - Core <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/core>`__
* `STAC API - Item Search <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/item-search>`__
   * `Fields Extension <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/fragments/fields>`__ (**COMING SOON**)
   * `Query Extension <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/fragments/query>`__ (**COMING SOON**)
   * `Sort Extension <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/fragments/sort>`__ (**COMING SOON**)
   * `Context Extension <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/fragments/context>`__ (**COMING SOON**)
* `STAC API - Features <https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec/tree/master/ogcapi-features>`__ (based on
  `OGC API - Features <https://www.ogc.org/standards/ogcapi-features>`__) (**COMING SOON**)

User Guide
----------

This section is primarily prose and describes how to use the package to interact with the various endpoints associated
with a STAC API service. The section is organized by the spec that each set of endpoints is associated with and also
includes user guides for working with paginated responses (from the ``/collections/{collection_id}/items`` and
``/search`` endpoints)..

API Documentation
-----------------

This section is autogenerated from in-line code documentation. It is mostly useful as a reference for the various
classes, methods, and other objects in the library, but is not intended to function as a starting point for working
with ``stac_api_client``.
